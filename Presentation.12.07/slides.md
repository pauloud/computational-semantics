$f_0 = \Box\langle  \lambda x. (P\ x) \rangle a$
$f_1 = \langle \lambda x.  \Box (P\ x) \rangle a$

 **If $f_0$ is De Re ($x$ is a place holder for the actual value of $a$)**
$\Box\langle  \lambda x. (P\ x) \rangle a$ is-reduced to $\langle  \lambda x. (P\ x) \rangle a$ and now have to be evaluated in every possible world

**If $f_0$ is De Re ($x$ is a place holder for the designator $a$)**
$\Box\langle  \lambda x. (P\ x) \rangle a$ is-reduced to $\Box(P\ x)$ where $x$ must be evaluated as a non-rigid designator which means $a$


 **If $f_1$ is De Re ($x$ is a place holder for the actual value of $a$ )**
$\langle \lambda x.  \Box (P\ x) \rangle a$ is reduced to $\Box (P\ x)$ where $x$ is a rigid designator for the actual value of $a$


 **If $f_1$ is De Dicto ($x$ is a place holder for the designator $a$ )**
$\langle \lambda x.  \Box (P\ x) \rangle a$ is reduced to $\Box(P\ x)$ where $x$ must be evaluated as a non-rigid designator which means $a$
